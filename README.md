⚠️ **NOTE!!!**

A major update was made to this repository in July 2021 --- in response to Pohl et al. (2021) --- to correct errors in both the repository and the original paper (Pataky et al. 2019). The errors are summarized in Pataky et al. (2021). 

Major repository changes include:

* Correction of the original **Appendix D**. Now there is NO DIVERGENCE between B-IK and LS-IK for a simple planar mechanism.
* Addition of **Appendix F**.  This is a new appendix which compares informative vs. vague priors on B-IK results, and which explains the previous, erroneous Appendix D results.
* Distribution of all corrected **source code**. Source code for the main manuscript's results was not included in the original repository due to subsequent work plans on 3D rotations. These plans have been executed, so there is no longer any need to withhold the source code.
* Distribution of all **simulation data**. These data were not provided in the original repository.
